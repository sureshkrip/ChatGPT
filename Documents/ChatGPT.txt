GPT-2 Simple: This is a lightweight version of the GPT-2 language model, which was trained on a large corpus of text and is capable of generating human-like text. GPT-2 Simple is a more lightweight version that can be trained on a smaller dataset and is suitable for use on smaller devices. It is implemented in Python using TensorFlow.

OpenAI GPT: This is an open source implementation of the GPT language model, which was developed by OpenAI. It is capable of generating natural language text and has been trained on a large corpus of text. It is implemented in Python using PyTorch.

Hugging Face Transformers: This is a library of pre-trained transformer models for natural language processing tasks, including language modeling, machine translation, and question answering. The models are pre-trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets for specific tasks. The library is implemented in Python using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

AllenNLP: This is a library of pre-trained natural language processing models, including language models, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. The library is designed for use in research and includes several state-of-the-art models for natural language processing tasks. It is implemented in Python using PyTorch.
